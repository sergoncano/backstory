#define SCRIPT "In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.\b\b\
Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry,\
 bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat:\n\
it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.\b\b\
It had a perfectly round door like a porthole, painted green, with a shiny yellow brass knob in the exact middle.\n\
The door opened on to a tube-shaped hall like a tunnel: a very comfortable tunnel without smoke, with panelled walls,\
and floors tiled and carpeted, provided with polished chairs, and lots and lots of pegs for hats and coats - the hobbit was fond of visitors.\b\b"
